# Re-former project

> This is the Re-Former project a tutorial and exercises to master the skills using forms in Ruby on Rails. This repository follows the instructions of The Odin Project. The final code is reviewed for a Microverse Technical Support Engineer TSE that supervises, makes suggestions, and approves the completeness of the final product.

## Description

In this project, we learned about forms, from the very basic to the Railsy-er ones. We learned how the information is gotten from the form and passed to the controller to create a new record in the database. We applied the previously acquired knowledge of Validations and flash messages.
